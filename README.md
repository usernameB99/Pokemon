## This is my Pokemon Arena Battle

- I used csv reader to read in two sheets with the Pokemons and Attacks.  
- I wrote Methods to create Pokemon Objects that each get two random attacks.  
- When a Pokemon got chosen, it will be cloned and sent to the arena for battle.
- Pokemons have different hp, attack and defense stats.  
- Attacks have different damage stats.  
- It is a 1 Player game that can be played with input in the console.  
- It can be played multiple rounds.
